Download Bootstrap
Download the latest Bootstrap from the official site → Choose "Compiled CSS and JS".

Extract the ZIP file
Unzip the downloaded file. You’ll see a folder named bootstrap-5.x.x-dist (the version number may vary).

Open the folder, and identify:

css/ folder → contains Bootstrap styles

js/ folder → contains JavaScript plugins

icons/ folder (optional, download Bootstrap Icons separately)

Write this in your notes or assignment:

css/: Contains precompiled Bootstrap CSS files. Use bootstrap.min.css for faster loading.

js/: Contains Bootstrap’s JS files. Use bootstrap.bundle.min.js to include all plugins and Popper.js.

icons/: (If available) Contains Bootstrap Icons, used to add vector-based icons to your web pages.
